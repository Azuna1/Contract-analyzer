# Contract-analyzer

Simply run the contracts.py. 

The download will include market data but it will be outdated. In  the main menu choose `[M] Market data import` to import fresh market data of Jita.

Select the region of which you want to import contracts of. You will need to write the name of the region exactly right.

Then start the import.

Results will be written in "profit.txt" in same folder. Copy the contents of this text file and paste it to mail writing window ingame. This will create clickable links to the contractrs.
If the profit.txt is too long to fit into the mail window you may need to copy-paste only part of it at a time.

* Python 3
